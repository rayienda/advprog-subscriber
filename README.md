## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

1. In this tutorial, we used RwLock<> to synchronise the use of Vec of Notifications. Explain why it is necessary for this case, and explain why we do not use Mutex<> instead?

In this case, we use RwLock because there are usually way more reads than writes. Many users might be checking notifications at the same time, but new ones don’t come in that often. RwLock lets many threads read at once, but still locks things properly when something needs to be written. If we used Mutex, even reading would force other threads to wait, which would slow things down for no reason.

2. In this tutorial, we used lazy_static external library to define Vec and DashMap as a “static” variable. Compared to Java where we can mutate the content of a static variable via a static function, why did not Rust allow us to do so?

Unlike Java, Rust doesn’t let us change static values freely because it wants to keep things safe from data bugs and memory issues. In Java, you can call a static method and update the value without much worry. But Rust makes sure that shared data is only changed in a safe way, especially when different threads might use it at the same time. That’s why we need help from something like lazy_static to sets things up properly so the data can be used safely.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2

1. Have you explored things outside of the steps in the tutorial, for example: src/lib.rs? If not, explain why you did not do so. If yes, explain things that you have learned from those other parts of code.

I haven’t explored beyond the tutorial steps yet. I focused on the files directly related to the tasks, like the modules for the controller, service, repository, and model, as those were highlighted in the tutorial. Since lib.rs wasn’t mentioned in the steps, I prioritized finishing the guided tasks before exploring other additional files.

2. Since you have completed the tutorial by now and have tried to test your notification system by spawning multiple instances of Receiver, explain how Observer pattern eases you to plug in more subscribers. How about spawning more than one instance of Main app, will it still be easy enough to add to the system?

The Observer pattern makes it really simple to add more subscribers to the system. Since each subscriber is just an instance that listens for updates from the Publisher, adding a new one is as easy as subscribing it to the relevant product type. The separation between the Publisher and Receiver apps also means new subscribers don’t require changes to the core logic, they just "plug in" via their URL and can start receiving updates.

As for spawning multiple instances of the Main app, it would still be fairly straightforward. The system is designed to be modular, so adding more Publisher instances or changing existing ones would just require configuring the environment and ensuring each instance runs on a different port. The flexibility of the Observer pattern allows you to easily manage these instances without much complexity.

3. Have you tried to make your own Tests, or enhance documentation on your Postman collection? If you have tried those features, tell us whether it is useful for your work (it can be your tutorial work or your Group Project).

I haven’t tried to create my own tests or improve the documentation in the Postman collection yet. I concentrated on finishing the tutorial tasks and implementing the necessary functionality. However, I recognize that these features would be helpful for making sure the API behaves as expected.
